# Reflection by Lamar Todd

    This lab was really unique as we had to use various skills from different
labs to complete this one. The print line statements are second nature now and
I am also getting used to the int, char and double commands. In the beginning
of this labI struggled with the first two steps as I kept making changes to
the wrong part of the code. All I had to do was change the source code
instead.

    As the lab progress the steps became easier and I finished the
lab in a decent amount of time. This was not the most difficult lab in
my opinion. It really helped develop my skills of everything I have learned so far.

    I am becoming more comfortable with these labs.
I can not wait to learn more. The different skills that we used
in the beginning of the semester are really relevant to what we try to do now.
